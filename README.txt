"CalculatorWindows" checks if input is a number or not.

"Calculator" doesn't have a input checker yet.

"Pixel Brave" is a game that I'm currently developing from scratch. Inside of it's folder there is a 
commented code sample and a demo (in both .exe and .apk extension, for Windows and Android respectively).
Ps.: The movement handle only works while playing on Androind. For Windows "Z" key jump, "X" key attack, "← and →" keys moves.
